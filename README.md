# Base64 Encoding and Decoding

This script demonstrates how to encode and decode data using Base64 in Python. Base64 is commonly used to encode binary data as ASCII characters, making it easier to transmit and store.

## Features

- **Encoding**: Converts a string into its Base64 encoded form.
- **Decoding**: Converts a Base64 encoded string back to its original form.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Arpita23r/UTF-8encoder.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```sh
   cd UTF-8encoder
   ```
3. **Run the script:**
   ```sh
   python base64_encoder_decoder.py
   ```
